   <p> 
       Wireless routers include software programs for managing network traffic, security features, and other functions to assign IP address to devices. This is crucially important because it allows for smooth Internet access and also provides security against possible cyber attacks or threats. In addition, these software programs also identifies each device on the networks, allowing them to communicate with other devices as well.

   <h2 style="color:rgb(132, 91, 183);">Who created wireless routers?</h2>
   <p>
      In 1977, the first wireless router was created with a team of 10 people. This team included hardware engineers, firmware developers, software developers, QA/Test engineers, product managers and security experts. However, for more complicated routers, more engineers will be needed. To create the router, the engineers needed skills in networking, software development, hardware design, and signal processing.

   <h2 style="color:rgb(132, 91, 183);">The Process</h2>
   <p>
      Creating a router involves designing the hardware components, such as processors and memory, and developing software to manage data routing and network protocols. After testing and optimization, the final design is mass-produced for distribution.
